# Creating a server
## In SPServer
- Open SPServer
- Click the 'create ps' button on the top menu
## In GitHub
- Fork this repo and then come back to it
- Open the 'servers' folder and create a new folder. Name the folder your private server's name.
- Create a file named 'data' and insert the following data to it: ``[""]``
- Wait for your pull request to be accepted by me
- Open SPServer
- Click 'join ps'
- Type in your private server name that you named your folder
- Click the 'upload' button to upload projects.
- One problem with this method is that there will be a placeholder project in your PS.
